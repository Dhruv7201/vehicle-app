# vehicle-app: A Responsible Vehicle Tracking System

Introduction

This application is designed to track vehicles using the Google Maps API. It provides features to display the locations of both registered and non-registered vehicles captured by cameras at various points.

Technology Stack

Backend: FastAPI - A high-performance web framework for Python that simplifies building APIs.
Frontend: React - A popular JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Database: MySQL - A widely used relational database management system for structured data storage.
Ethical Considerations

Navigate to the Project Directory:

Bash

```
cd ethics-utdb-vehicle-app
```

Start the Application with Docker Compose:

Bash

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will utilize Docker Compose to manage the dependencies (FastAPI, React, MySQL) and launch the application in detached mode (-d).
